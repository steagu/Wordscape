I wrote this short python script after I got a game on my phone called Wordscape. It's a word game and I thoroughly enjoyed it
for a couple of weeks until I realized that I could pretty easily write a program to generate the solutions for me. I had
fun writing this script for that purpose, but after writing the script, I found the game quite boring. Because of that, I
haven't used this script since. It could also be used rather effectively to help someone cheat at Scrabble or another similar 
game.

Here is the link for the app that inspired this Python script:
